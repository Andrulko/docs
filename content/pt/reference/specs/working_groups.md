The design IPFS protocols and implementation of reference software are all managed by a variety of working groups. You can learn more about our governing structure in [RFC 0002](https://github.com/ipfs/rfcs/blob/8e2587cec2ebd3e585cb1cb78bd4df18024428c3/rfcs/0002-ipfs-governance.md). Active working groups are:

- TODO: Document existing working groups, their processes, and where work/discussion happens.
- Should this wait for https://github.com/ipfs/rfcs/pull/2 ?
