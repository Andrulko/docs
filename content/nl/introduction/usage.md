## Install IPFS

If you haven’t done so already, your first step is to **install IPFS**! Most people prefer to install a prebuilt package, which you can do on the [IPFS distributions page](https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs) by clicking “Install go-ipfs” (our reference implementation written in Go) and then following the instructions for [installing from a prebuilt package]({{X28X}}#installing-from-a-prebuilt-package).

<a class="button button-primary" href="https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs" role="button">
  Download IPFS for your platform &nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</a>

<aside class="alert alert-info">
  Don’t want to use the command line right now? You can give the desktop-app implementation of IPFS a go! <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop">Get started with IPFS Desktop here <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt fa-sm"></i></a>

For more install options, such as building from source, and toubleshooting tips, visit our [install guide]({{X32X}}). If you have any questions or get stuck, feel free to ask for help in [the Help section of the IPFS forums](https://discuss.ipfs.io/c/help) or in [#ipfs on chat.freenode.net](irc://chat.freenode.net/%23ipfs).

## Initialize the repository

`ipfs` stores all its settings and internal data in a directory called the *repository.* Before using IPFS for the first time, you’ll need to initialize the repository with the `ipfs init` command:

```sh
> ipfs init
initializing ipfs node at /Users/jbenet/.go-ipfs
generating 2048-bit RSA keypair...done
peer identity: Qmcpo2iLBikrdf1d6QU6vXuNb6P7hwrbNPW9kLAH8eG67z
to get started, enter:

  ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/readme

```

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <p>
        If you are running on a server in a data center, you should initialize IPFS with the <code>server</code> profile. This will prevent IPFS from creating a lot of data center-internal traffic trying to discover local nodes:
    </p>!!crwd_CB_26_BC_dwrc!!</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    The hash after <code>peer identity: </code> is your node’s ID and will be different from the one shown in the above output. Other nodes on the network use it to find and connect to you. You can run <code>ipfs id</code> at any time to get it again if you need it.
</div>

Now, try running the command suggested to you in the output of `ipfs init`. The one that looks like `ipfs cat /ipfs/<HASH>/readme`.

You should see something like this:

```
Hello and Welcome to IPFS!

██╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗
██║██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝
██║██████╔╝█████╗  ███████╗
██║██╔═══╝ ██╔══╝  ╚════██║
██║██║     ██║     ███████║
╚═╝╚═╝     ╚═╝     ╚══════╝

If you're seeing this, you have successfully installed
IPFS and are now interfacing with the ipfs merkledag!

 -------------------------------------------------------
| Warning:                                              |

Check out some of the other files in this directory:

  ./about
  ./help
  ./quick-start     <-- usage examples
  ./readme          <-- this file
  ./security-notes

```

You can explore other objects in the repository. In particular, the `quick-start` directory which shows example commands to try:

```sh
ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/quick-start
```

## Taking your Node Online

Once you're ready to join your node to the public network, run the ipfs daemon in another terminal and wait for all three lines below to appear to know that your node is ready:

```sh
> ipfs daemon
Initializing daemon...
API server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001
Gateway server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
Make note of the tcp ports you receive. If they are different, use yours in the commands below.
</div>

Now, switch back to your original terminal. If you’re connected to the network, you should be able to see the ipfs addresses of your peers when you run:

```sh
> ipfs swarm peers
/ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ
/ip4/104.236.151.122/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmSoLju6m7xTh3DuokvT3886QRYqxAzb1kShaanJgW36yx
/ip4/134.121.64.93/tcp/1035/ipfs/QmWHyrPWQnsz1wxHR219ooJDYTvxJPyZuDUPSDpdsAovN5
/ip4/178.62.8.190/tcp/4002/ipfs/QmdXzZ25cyzSF99csCQmmPZ1NTbWTe8qtKFaZKpZQPdTFB
```

These are a combination of `<transport address>/ipfs/<hash-of-public-key>`.

Now, you should be able to get objects from the network. Try:

```sh
ipfs cat /ipfs/QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ/cat.jpg >cat.jpg
open cat.jpg
```

Next try sending objects to the network, and then viewing it in your favorite browser. The example below uses `curl` as the browser, but you can open the IPFS URL in other browsers as well:

```sh
> hash=`echo "I <3 IPFS -$(whoami)" | ipfs add -q`
> curl "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/$hash"
I <3 IPFS -<your username>
```

Cool, huh? The gateway served a file _from your computer_. The gateway queried the Distributed hash table (DHT), found your machine, requested the file, your machine sent it to the gateway, and the gateway sent it to your browser.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    Depending on the state of the network, <code>curl</code> may take a while. The public gateways may be overloaded or having a hard time reaching you.
</div>

You can also check it out at your own local gateway:

```sh
> curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/$hash"
I <3 IPFS -<your username>
```

By default, your gateway is not exposed to the world, it only works locally.

## Web Console

We also have a web console you can use to check the state of your node. In your favorite web browser, open:

<pre><code><a href="http://localhost:5001/webui">http://localhost:5001/webui</a></code></pre>

This should bring up a console like this:

## Companion Browser Extension

While we are at it,  [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#ipfs-companion) is a browser extension that simplifies access to IPFS resources and adds support for the IPFS protocol.

<div class="alert alert-info">
It will automatically redirect IPFS gateway requests to
your local daemon so that you are not relying on, or trusting, remote gateways.
</div>

It runs in Firefox (Desktop and Android) and various Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or Brave. Check [its features](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#features) and [**install it**](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#install) today!
