IPFS can be used to store and play videos. Suppose we add a video:

```
ipfs add -q sintel.mp4 | tail -n1
```

Take the resulting hash, You can view it a couple different ways:

On the command line:
```
ipfs cat $vidhash | mplayer -vo xv -
```

Via local gateway:
```
mplayer http://localhost:8080/ipfs/$vidhash

# or open it up in a tab in chrome (or firefox)

chromium http://localhost:8080/ipfs/$vidhash
```
(Note: the gateway method works with most video players and browsers)
